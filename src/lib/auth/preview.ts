/**
 * Shared LIVE-PREVIEW OAuth client (server-only — NEVER import from the client).
 *
 * The sandbox serves each live preview on a dynamic `https://*.grok-sandbox.com`
 * URL, which can't be pre-registered per app. The broker instead exposes ONE
 * shared "preview" client that accepts any
 * `https://*.grok-sandbox.com/api/auth/oauth2/callback/*`
 * (broker: `app-builder-deployer/auth/src/preview-oauth.ts`). When
 * `PREVIEW_CLIENT_SECRET` is set, the live preview can do REAL sign-in — no
 * demo/mock users. When deployed the deployer injects a per-app
 * `GROK_AUTH_*` that overrides these (see `server.ts`).
 *
 * Client id is public (`grok_preview`). The matching client secret MUST come
 * from the environment (`PREVIEW_CLIENT_SECRET`, or `GROK_PREVIEW_CLIENT_SECRET`)
 * — never bake it into git. When the secret is unset, federated preview sign-in
 * stays off (fail closed — see `authConfigured` in `server.ts`). Deployed apps
 * use per-app `GROK_AUTH_*` and do not need this fallback.
